## Git Workflow
Any changes made to the local codebase need to be pushed to the repository automatically as soon as they are completed.

When making changes:
1. Make the necessary code changes
2. Add all changes to git staging
3. Commit with a descriptive message
4. Push to the remote repository immediately

This ensures the repository stays synchronized with all local development work.
